    <p>The journey up to this WDI has been hectic and rewarding to say the least. After making the decision to attend, I found out my work was cut out for me.
         I was excited for the change and oppportunities it can afford me. I was not ready for the hangups in financial aid,
         budget, and rate of absorbtion my brain seems to be limiting me to. Taking on these challenges was incredibly difficult, 
         but I feel each one provides me with a key to success that will allow easier handling of similar hangups down the road. 
         More than that, I illustrated to me, how bad I want to build this skill and create a carreer in it. Now, here, at the dawn of this new begining, 
         I take a confident step forward in defiance of the trepidation I feel </p>
         <p>In the WDI I look to gather as much marketable skill as I can to present to firms to find a good fit for my desire to solve problems at work
            in an evironment that is positive and nurtures a balance work:life ratio and that will allow me to pursue my hobbies and travel to see my friends 
            and family across the world. Being a developer excites me at the opportunities it will offer internationally. The cealing is so high it feels
            as though the sky is truly the limit if I want to grow my skill.</p>
