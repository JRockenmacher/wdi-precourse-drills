    <p>Neither am I a girl, from a small town, and my world sure isn't lonely (especially in Denver).
        My name is Jean-Scott "JR" Rockenmacher and I want to create a career in coding. I grew up in the north end
        of San Diego County in the city of Carlsbad. I was always a creative weirdo, but so are my parents and 
        I do not see it as a bad thing, as it has shaped both my personality and cognition. Growing up wasn't 
        terrible but being a brazen, unique individual in a society that values artifice did net me all the 
        benefits of one who operates against the grain. With my upbringing and the local societal experience, I 
        risked moving to denver for a semester at a school for prospecive protestant missionaries. I attended 
        a second semester, after which, I decided to stay. I fell in love with the compact nature of the metro area, 
        the warmth of its people, and the cultural and recreational ammenities it had. I "grew-up" in my 20's here, 
        and became the person I wanted to be. The journey hasn't been easy though: as intelligent and talented as 
        I am with a variety of things, I have learned (still learning) how to manage life and finances and make 
        choices that give me the most freedom to pursue the life I want. My friends I have collected as a result
        of the personal growth I went through in my 20's have pushed me to find a career to afford me the freedom
        to pursue the life I want and that is mentally stimulating to be satisfied and challenged with my work.</p>
        <p>Since moving out here in 2005, I have picked up a few hobbies.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Racing and tuning cars</li>
            <li>Camping with as little ammenities possibel</li>
            <li>Challenging myself to create new recipes that marry delicious food with healthy, humane, and sustainbly sourced ingredients</li>
            <li>Scouring the city for new coffee shops and ethnic foods</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>All in all, I'm a decent guy trying to live my life intentionally and with deliberate, well-thought-out decisions. I like putting effort
            into all that I plan to do, so I can make the most out of any project I undertake. I continue to grow in the liberal arts to keep myself 
            well rounded and mentally flexible. Till jumping into coding, I didn't think I would ever find a calling, but how enthusiastic I am about
            learning and implement what I learn, I ventue to put my hopes into the possibility web-development may be it. Which brings me to where I am
            today! </p>
